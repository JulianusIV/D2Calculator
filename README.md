# D2Calculator

A C# WPF App to calculate shots to kill in different circumstances for Destiny2

### Currently working:

- Calculate shots to kill for every resilience level given a baseline bodyshot damage value and a baseline crit value (this will be deprecated and removed with the full implementation of the archetype selector)
- Calculate shots to kill for every resilience level for a select few archetypes, this wil replace beforementioned STK with manual damage input
- Accuracy calculation (taking into account accuracy, instead of optimal STK)

### Planned/WIP

- Expand Archetype selection to include all archetypes
- Calculate shots to kill for each resilience level based on archetype and damage modifier (empowering rift etc...)
- Calculate shots to kill based on Range
